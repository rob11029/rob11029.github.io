<h3>Lab 8</h3>
<p>Of my top 3 labs for this semester, Lab 8 was my favorite. Lab 8 was about poker and since I personally was really intrigued, not by the lab but actually learning how to play. I also really liked how we used one class slot to teach us how to play and all the key terms and styles of winning and playing.</p>
