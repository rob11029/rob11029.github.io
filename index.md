<h3>Lab 8</h3>
<p>Of my top 3 labs for this semester, Lab 8 was my favorite. Lab 8 was about poker and since I personally was really intrigued, not by the lab but actually learning how to play. I also really liked how we used one class slot to teach us how to play and all the key terms and styles of winning and playing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Lab 6</h3>
<p>The next best lab in my opinion was lab 6 part 1. Lab 6 part 1 constituted about of the sandwich discussion in which it sparked a conversation on what would we consider a sandwich, would a certain style, or ingredients dictate that? Personally I have a sandwich everyday for my lunch at work and it is nothing similar to what we discussed in class.</p>
<h3>Lab 1</h3>
<p>My third and final favorite lab was lab 1. I have to main reasons as to why this is my favorite, the first one being that I completely did it all myself because my lab partner didn&#39;t do his reading or even try for that fact at all. Lastly, and the most obvious reason being it was the first lab and the easiest of the semester of course.</p>
